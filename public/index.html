                <b>Taung Child Foundation (TCF)</b> is a youth development volunteer organisation operating in and
                around
                the Greater Taung District Municipality, in the North-West Province of South Africa.<br/>Our name is
                inspired by and pays homage to the original Taung Child, a 2.8 million years old hominid fossil
                which
                was
                discovered in the village of Buxton in Taung in 1924.<br/>Despite being at the centre of human
                evolution,
                Taung remains one of the most impoverished and underdeveloped areas in South Africa.<br/> Poverty is
                a
                rampant and systemic issue in this rural area with devastating impacts on the lives of the people
                who
                call
                this region home, especially the youth. Our goal as Taung Child Foundation is, together with other
                stakeholders, play a strategic and active role in improving the quality of the lives of the youth in
                this
                region.<br/><br/><b>Our mission is to help every Taung Child realise their full
                potential.</b><br/><br/>The African philosophy of Ubuntu or Botho in Setswana, the local language of
                Taung, is what inspires us and a vision for a just and equal world is what drives us. We have heart,
                bold
                plans and a network of talented and enthusiastic people who want to help every rural child go beyond
                their
                wildest dreams and every day obstacles – starting in the home of the Taung Child.

                With an unemployment rate of 49.8% (62% of which accounts for youth unemployment) and high poverty
                levels,
                the Greater Taung District, in the North-West Province, is one of the most underdeveloped and
                impoverished
                areas in the country. Located about 250km south of the capital, Mahikeng, the municipality is home
                to
                almost 170 000 people scattered over 106 villages of varying sizes.  Dependent largely on an
                agriculture
                based economy, job opportunities are scarce and service delivery is poor. In fact, the recent
                Government
                Performance Index, compiled by research and advocacy group Good Governance Africa (GGA) and released
                in
                February 2016, ranked the municipality as one of the 20 worst managed municipalities in the country
                (it
                was ranked 216 out of 234 municipalities).<br/>Quality education and youth development remains
                inaccessible to many young people in Taung. With many schools in the area are poorly resourced,
                operating
                without libraries, computer and science labs and sports facilities and equipment. The area is also a
                victim of the digital divide with approximately 80% of the population living without access to the
                internet.<br/>Poor quality and low levels of education, lack of employment and development
                opportunities
                as well as the digital divide inhibit young people in this region to realise their full potential
                and
                live
                their best life. Without well informed, skilled and employed young people, Taung will remain in the
                clutches of poverty and so will her people.<br/><br/><u>Key stats:</u><br/>
                <ul>
                  <li>Almost half of the area’s population is unemployed (at 49, 8% unemployment rate), with the

                TCF was born in 2011 as a <a href='https://www.facebook.com/taungchildfoundation/'>platform on
                Facebook</a>
                to connect with young people in the area and provide them with education and career information
                that they
                would otherwise not have access to. In February 2019, we formally registered non-profit with the
                South
                African government and we are now working to transition from an online platform to a fully
                functioning
                community organization which is making an impact on the ground.<br/>Our vision is future in which
                every
                Taung Child has the opportunity and resources to reach their greatest potential. We want to go to
                beyond…together.<br/><br/><u>We have four urgent goals:</u>
              <li>Improve the quality and quantity of matric pass rates.</li>
              <li>Increase number of Taung learners entering institutions of higher learning and graduating.</li>
              <li>Bridge the digital divide and upskill the youth in ICT.</li>
              <li>Provide meaningful and sustainable development and employment opportunities for the youth in the
                area.

                      TCF was born in 2011 as a <a href='https://www.facebook.com/taungchildfoundation/'>platform on
                      Facebook</a>
                      to connect with young people in the area and provide them with education and career
                      information
                      that they
                      would otherwise not have access to. In February 2019, we formally registered non-profit with
                      the
                      South
                      African government and we are now working to transition from an online platform to a fully
                      functioning
                      community organization which is making an impact on the ground.<br/>Our vision is future in
                      which
                      every
                      Taung Child has the opportunity and resources to reach their greatest potential. We want to go
                      to
                      beyond…together.<br/><br/><u>We have four urgent goals:</u>
                    <li>Improve the quality and quantity of matric pass rates.</li>
                    <li>Increase number of Taung learners entering institutions of higher learning and graduating.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bridge the digital divide and upskill the youth in ICT.</li>
                    <li>Provide meaningful and sustainable development and employment opportunities for the youth in
                      the
                      area.
